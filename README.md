# ng-twitterClient

## How to Setup

1. Fork it.
2. Clone it
3. Move it into a web server's directory and visit the directory in your browser following your server hostname and port.(e.g., http://localhost:8888/ng-twitterClien
#### If you don't have a webserver installed
I recommend a quick http-server using nodejs.
